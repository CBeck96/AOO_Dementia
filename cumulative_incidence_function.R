# Cumulative incidence function 

# This function works in the set-up of competing risk, where the states are:
# Healthy, Diagnosed, and death and emigrated.

# Packages used:
# prodlim

# Input:
# dat    : Data used
# se     : Indicator to include confidence intervals. Default is False.


# Output:
# Gives a list of the following
#   1) CIR: A data frame containing: 
#        - time given in ages
#        - Survival 
#        - Cumulative incidence for the state diagnosed
#        - Cumulative incidence for the state death and emigration 
#   2) lower: Lower confidence limits (Structure as above, without time)
#   3) upper: Upper confidence limits (Structure as above, without time)
#   4) model: Model fitted on the data

  # is the status of exit.
